## 🏆 Technologies used

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)

## 💻 How to run?

Frist navigate inside the project's folder and run npm install to download the proper dependencies. I personally prefer
to use yarn as a package manager, but all commands will work with either yarn or npm. In case you choose npm, just go
for 'npm run ' + command instead of 'yarn' + command.

```bash
cd reactnative-calculator
yarn install

cd ios
pod install

cd ..
yarn ios
```
